# Self-Driving-Cars-RaspberryPi
The self-driving car is built on the Raspberry Pi platform, utilizing image processing technology and deep
learning algorithms to recognize traffic signs, detect lanes, and avoid obstacles.

1. Lane Detection: This functionality employs image processing techniques supported by
OpenCV to acquire lane boundaries.
2. Traffic-sign Recognition: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is employed to recognize each
type of sign
